## Protocol Safety

All integrated protocols are:

- Established with significant TVL
- Audited by reputable security firms
- Battle-tested on mainnet

Underscore only integrates protocols that meet strict security standards.

## What Are Legos?

Legos are standardized adapters that give your wallet access to each protocol. They handle the complexity of interacting with different smart contracts behind a consistent interface.

**Benefits of the Lego architecture**:

- **Simplicity**: One interface for all protocols
- **Safety**: Audited adapters with built-in protections
- **Future-proof**: New protocols work automatically
- **Composability**: Combine operations across protocols in single transactions
