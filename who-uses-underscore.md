# Who Uses Underscore: Infrastructure for the Future of Finance

Underscore isn't a consumer app — it's the rails that power the next generation of financial applications. Users experience Underscore through the apps they love, without ever knowing it's there.

Think of Underscore like AWS for DeFi. Just as millions use Netflix without knowing about Amazon's servers, millions will use financial apps powered by Underscore's infrastructure. The complexity stays under the hood while users enjoy seamless experiences.

Underscore provides the core components — [User Wallets](user-wallet.md), [Managers](managers.md) for delegation, [Payees](payees.md) for recurring payments, [Cheques](cheques.md) for one-time transfers, and [Whitelists](whitelist.md) for trusted addresses — that developers combine to create powerful financial applications.

### How End Users Experience Underscore

Users interact with friendly apps while Underscore handles the complexity:

- **Earning Yield**: "Deposit USDC, earn 8% APY" → Underscore routes to optimal protocols
- **Making Payments**: "Send $500 to contractor" → Underscore [cheque system](cheques.md) ensures safety
- **Portfolio Management**: "AI optimizes my yield" → Underscore [manager](managers.md) executes strategies
- **Asset Swaps**: "Trade ETH for USDC" → Underscore finds best rates across DEXs
- **Borrowing**: "Borrow against my ETH" → Underscore Ripe Protocol Lego manages collateral safely

The user sees a simple interface. Underscore does the heavy lifting.

## Case Study: Hightop

[Hightop](https://hightop.com) is a mobile app that demonstrates the power of building on Underscore infrastructure. Here's how they leverage different Underscore components to create a seamless user experience:

### What Hightop Offers Users

Through an intuitive mobile interface, Hightop users can:

- **Earn Yield** on their assets with one tap

### How Underscore Powers Each Feature

**AI Private Banker (The Magic)**

- Currently optimizes yield by rebalancing between Aave, Morpho, Euler, Compound, Fluid
- Soon: Will execute complex DeFi strategies, manage debt positions, and capture arbitrage
- Operates within user-defined limits (e.g., "Only touch stablecoins", "Keep 20% in ETH")
- Adapts strategies based on market conditions and user goals
- Like having a Wall Street quant working 24/7 for your personal portfolio
- Users wake up to optimized positions and captured opportunities

**Yield Generation**

- Hightop uses Underscore's Lego integrations to access Morpho, Moonwell, Aave, and other yield protocols
- Users see "8.5% APY on USDC" — Underscore handles the protocol routing
- Their AI Manager automatically rebalances between protocols to optimize yields

**Asset Swaps**

- Leverages Underscore's DEX integrations (Uniswap, Curve, Aerodrome)
- Users swap with one tap — Underscore finds optimal routes
- No need to approve tokens for each protocol

**Borrowing**

- Utilizes Underscore's debt management Legos, specifically Ripe Protocol
- Users see simple "Borrow up to 50% of collateral"
- Underscore manages the complex protocol interactions

**User Withdrawals**

- Users' personal wallets are added to Underscore's [Whitelist](whitelist.md)
- Enables instant withdrawals with no limits
- Provides emergency exit if needed
- Maintains non-custodial security

### The Hightop User Experience

From the user's perspective:

1. Download [Hightop](https://hightop.com) app
2. Deposit USDC (soon fiat onramps)
3. Enable "AI Private Banker" for Yield Auto-Pilot
4. Watch balance grow
5. Withdraw anytime

What they never see:

- Token approvals for 20+ protocols
- Yield protocol comparisons
- Slippage calculations
- Smart contract interactions
- Permission management
- Any concept of gas, private keys, or seed phrases

They just earn. The complexity vanishes. That's the power of building on Underscore.
