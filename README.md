# Underscore Protocol: Intelligent Financial Automation

Transform your static wallet into a dynamic financial operating system. One that connects to every top DeFi protocol, enables automated strategies through secure delegation, and maintains institutional-grade security — all through a single interface.

**Atomic Operations**: Rebalance $500k across five protocols in one transaction. Move from Aave's 7% to Morpho's 12% APY in one click. Claim rewards, swap to USDC, and re-deploy — what took 15 minutes and 5 transactions now happens instantly.

**Secure Delegation**: Let AI agents capture that 15% APY spike at 3am while you sleep. Enable your CFO to pay $100k in vendor invoices without touching your $2M reserves. Set exact position limits: "Trade up to $50k USDC but never touch my ETH." Every action validated against your rules, revocable with one click.

**Unified Protocol Access**: No more tab juggling or phishing risks. Your Underscore wallet connects directly to Morpho, Aerodrome, Aave, Uniswap, and every major protocol through battle-tested adapters. Execute a Morpho deposit → Aerodrome swap → Aave leverage strategy in a single transaction.

**Intelligent Payment Rails**: Pay contractors with 72-hour cancellation windows using Digital Cheques. Let employees pull their exact $5k monthly salary (not a penny more) as Payees. Move millions between your own wallets instantly via Whitelist. Your funds earn 5% APY until the millisecond they're needed.

Your wallet shouldn't just hold money. It should make money. Every second. Automatically.

## The Magic: How It All Works Together

Your Underscore Wallet isn't just one thing — it's an ecosystem of intelligent features working in harmony.

### Example Day in Your Financial Life

**5 AM**: Your [AI Manager](managers.md) notices Morpho offering 1% better yield than Aave. It automatically rebalances $50k, capturing extra yield while you sleep.

**10 AM**: Monthly rent is due. Your landlord (configured as [Payee](payees.md)) pulls exactly $2,500 USDC. Not a penny more. Your remaining funds keep earning yield.

**2 PM**: You need to pay a contractor. Create a $5,000 [cheque](cheques.md) with 3-day delay. If they don't deliver, cancel it. Simple.

**4 PM**: Time to fund your aggressive trading wallet. Move $20k to your other Underscore wallet ([whitelisted](whitelist.md)) instantly. Your AI agent spots an arbitrage opportunity.

**11 PM**: Your portfolio rebalanced 3 times today across 5 protocols. You didn't lift a finger..

## Common Questions

**Is my wallet upgradeable?**  
No. Your wallet code is immutable for security. New features come through Lego integrations. If new features come, you can migrate to a new Underscore wallet.

**What are Legos?**  
Standardized integrations with DeFi protocols. When new protocols launch, your wallet can use them immediately.

**Can I use multiple wallets?**  
Yes. Whitelist them for instant transfers between your wallets.

**What about L2s?**  
Currently Base L2 only. More chains coming.

**How do fees work?**  
Small fees on swaps (0.25%), yield profits (10%), and external reward claims (10%). No fees on transfers, deposits, or idle funds. Up to 50% of fees go to ambassadors and users through revenue sharing.

**What happens if I lose my owner wallet?**  
If you've set up managers and whitelisted addresses beforehand, managers can still transfer funds to your whitelisted addresses (like hardware wallets), providing a recovery path.

**Can managers steal my funds?**  
No. Managers operate within blockchain-enforced limits. They can only perform authorized actions within your spending caps and cannot withdraw to external addresses or modify their own permissions.

**How do I handle emergency transfers?**  
Pre-whitelist your hardware wallet or secure addresses. Unlike payees (with limits) or cheques (with delays), whitelisted addresses can receive unlimited transfers instantly for emergencies.

## The Future of Financial Operations

Remember those 10 tabs you had open, constantly checking URLs? The yield opportunities you missed at 3am? The manual approvals, one by one, for every protocol?

That's not DeFi. That's DeFi handicapped by tools from 2020.

Underscore delivers what crypto promised: programmable money that works as hard as you do. Your funds earning across protocols while maintaining liquidity for payments. Your trusted operators executing strategies within unbreakable boundaries. Your security protecting without restricting.

This isn't about choosing the lesser evil. It's about having everything — automation and control, security and accessibility, simplicity and power.

One wallet. Every protocol. Total control.

Stop managing wallets. Start managing wealth.
