description: How Underscore generates revenue and what happens with it

# Protocol Economics

Underscore generates revenue through fees on value-generating activities. All protocol revenue is used to buy back RIPE tokens from [Ripe Protocol](https://ripe.finance), our partner protocol.

## Revenue Sources

### Vault Performance Fees (Primary)

The largest source of protocol revenue comes from [Vaults](vaults.md) — AI-managed yield strategies that optimize returns across DeFi protocols.

- **Fee**: 20% of yield profits
- **Applied to**: Profits only, never principal
- **When charged**: When yield is realized

**Example**: A vault generates $100,000 in yield across all depositors
- $20,000 → Protocol revenue
- $80,000 → Distributed to depositors via increased share price

Vault performance fees scale with protocol TVL and yield performance, making this the primary revenue driver as Underscore grows.

### Swap Fees

Charged on token swaps executed through Underscore wallets.

- **Fee**: 0.25% of trade amount
- **Applied to**: All swaps (including stablecoin pairs)

**Example**: $10,000 swap → $25 fee

### External Reward Claim Fees

Charged when claiming rewards from integrated protocols (MORPHO, WELL, AERO, etc.).

- **Fee**: 20% of claimed rewards
- **Applied to**: External protocol incentives only

**Example**: Claim $200 in MORPHO rewards → $40 fee

## Summary

| Revenue Source | Fee | Relative Size |
| -------------- | --- | ------------- |
| Vault Performance | 20% of yield | Largest (scales with TVL) |
| Swap Fees | 0.25% of amount | Medium |
| External Rewards | 20% of claims | Smaller |

**100% of revenue → RIPE buybacks**
