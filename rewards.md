# Rewards: Earn RIPE Tokens

Earn RIPE tokens — the governance token of [Ripe Protocol](https://ripe.finance) — just by using Underscore. The more yield you generate and the more you hold, the more RIPE you earn.

**Two ways to earn:**

1. **Yield Bonuses** — Get a 1:1 RIPE match on your yield profits
2. **Deposit Rewards** — Earn RIPE based on how much you hold and for how long

Invite friends and earn RIPE on their yield profits too.

## Yield Bonuses (1:1 RIPE Match)

When you realize yield profits, you get bonus RIPE tokens on top:

- **1:1 match** — for every $1 of yield you earn, get $1 worth of RIPE
- Paid automatically when withdrawing yield
- Applies to yield strategies only (not swaps or reward claims)
- Requires available RIPE balance in distributor (first-come, first-served)

**Example**: You withdraw $1,000 in yield profit
- You keep your $1,000 profit (in the yield asset)
- You also receive ~$1,000 worth of RIPE tokens

### Referral Bonuses

Invite friends to Underscore and earn RIPE when they profit:

- **1:1 match** — for every $1 of yield your referred user earns, you get $1 worth of RIPE
- Your friend still gets their full 1:1 bonus too
- Both parties benefit from the same yield event

**Example**: Your friend realizes $1,000 in yield profit
- Friend keeps $1,000 profit + gets ~$1,000 RIPE bonus
- You get ~$1,000 RIPE bonus for referring them

## Deposit Rewards

Earn RIPE simply by holding assets in your Underscore wallet:

```
Points = (USD Value × Blocks Held)
Your Share = Your Points / Total Global Points
```

**How it works**:

1. Hold assets in your [wallet](user-wallet.md)
2. Accumulate points over time
3. Claim your proportional share of the RIPE rewards pool

**Example**:
- Hold $10,000 for 2 weeks
- Total protocol points = 3,024, your points = 60.48 (2% share)
- $5,000 worth of RIPE in pool → You claim ~$100 worth of RIPE

## RIPE Token Details

RIPE is the governance token of [Ripe Protocol](https://ripe.finance), Underscore's integrated borrowing protocol. Your RIPE can be:

- **Held** for potential appreciation
- **Staked** in Ripe governance for voting power and additional rewards
- **Traded** on supported exchanges

### Auto-Staking

Currently, **80% of RIPE rewards are automatically staked** in Ripe's governance vault with a 180-day lock period. The remaining 20% is sent directly to your wallet. This gives you instant staking benefits without extra transactions.

## Fee Structure

Underscore charges small fees on certain activities:

| Activity | Fee | Applied To |
| -------- | --- | ---------- |
| Swaps | 0.25% | Trade amount |
| External Rewards | 20% | Protocol reward claims (MORPHO, WELL, etc.) |
| Vault Performance | 20% | Vault yield profits only |

**No fees on**: Transfers, deposits, idle funds, or principal.

## Future: Ambassador Revenue Share

In addition to the RIPE yield bonuses described above, ambassadors may also receive a percentage of fees in-kind (paid in the same asset as the fee). This feature exists in the protocol but revenue share ratios are currently set to 0%.

## Common Questions

**Q: When can I claim?**
A: Immediately after rewards accumulate, subject to cooldown. [Managers](managers.md) can claim on your behalf if authorized.

**Q: Can rewards be lost?**
A: No, they accumulate until claimed (limited by contract balance).

**Q: Do bonuses always pay out?**
A: Only if distributor has sufficient RIPE balance. First-come, first-served.

**Q: How do deposit points work?**
A: Points = deposit value × time. More deposits + longer holding = more points = larger share of the rewards pool.

**Q: Is my RIPE automatically staked?**
A: Yes. 80% is auto-staked in Ripe governance with a 180-day lock. 20% goes directly to your wallet.

## The Bottom Line
